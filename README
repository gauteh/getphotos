Used to restore photos on an 120gb video iPod.

You need: Matlab, scons/c++ compiler

Copy Photos folder somewhere and use as source (don't risk running
directly on iPod), but there are no guarantees for anything anyway.

Compile using 'scons':
$ scons

Make output dir:
$ mkdir out

Extract 720x480 YUV 4:2:0 images:
$ ./getphotos -s /path/to/Photos out/

-s = only extract sources, the only thing that makes sense right now.
-h = show usage / help

In matlab, cd out/source/big run yuvtorgb.m (number of extracted files), it
will iterate from 1 to the number you specify and convert the files to BMP,
you can easily modify the script to output JPG's or other if you wish.

BMP files should end up in out/ dir
